## Ping Pong Game
This is a simple Ping Pong game written in JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas element.

### How to Play
Use the up and down arrow keys to move both the top and bottom rods together to hit the ball.
If the ball goes past your rod, the other player scores a point.
The game ends when one player scores 5 points.
The player with the highest score is recorded in local storage for future games.
If you beat the highest score, you can enter your name to record your score.
